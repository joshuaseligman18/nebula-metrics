In other words, Rust is memory safe from its additional checks at compile time, which greatly improves memory safety through reduced memory leaks and other bad practices within our programs. Rust comes with the Cargo package manager to easily add external dependencies to our programs without the need for manually writing a build script to compile and link everything together.</description></item></channel></rss>
